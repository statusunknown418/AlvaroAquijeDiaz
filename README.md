- Hi, Iâ€™m @AlvaroAquijeDiaz

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and using MongoDB with Mongoose, ExpressJS and GraphQL with Apollo client on new projects.

# Me
- I'm a Biomedical engineer, but I've been very interested in programming since some time ago, so I decided to start a Front
End Developer career, and now I'm onto a Fullstack career path for what I feel very passionate about.

# Contact me
