- Hi, Iâ€™m @AlvaroAquijeDiaz

- Learning Rust (ppl like to say it'll make you a better programmer), just for fun

# Me
- I'm a Biomedical engineer, but I've been very interested in programming since some time ago, so I decided to start a Front
End Developer career, and now I'm a passionate Fullstack Developer who loves experimenting with the newest and hottest technologies.
